# De-concierge Subgraph

The Graph project to index:

- PropertyRegistry events (property creation, ENS linkage, metadata updates)
- BookingLedger events (bookings, confirmations, conflicts, refunds)
- PaymentEscrow events (permit intake, payouts)

Roadmap:

1. Scaffold subgraph using `graph init --studio`.
2. Define schema aligned with analytics + AI intent needs.
3. Deploy to hosted service for the hackathon demo.
