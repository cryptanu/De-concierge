# De-concierge Services

This package will house the TypeScript workers and agent logic:

- Calendar ingestion (iCal, Nylas) + Flare Data Connector attestations
- Duplicate detection engine (deterministic scoring + LLM fallback)
- Booking agent runner (Polygon confirmations, Circle payments, notifications)
- Intent orchestrator (OpenAI, pgvector)

Implementation stubs and infra scripts will be added in upcoming commits.
